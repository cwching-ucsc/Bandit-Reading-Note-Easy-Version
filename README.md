# Bandit Reading Note

## Dr. Ji's recommanded open source bandit textbooks:

Please see below two books on multi-armed bandits.

Introduction to Multi-Armed Bandits (Sec. 7.1 is about online routing problem)
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07272.pdf

Bandit Algorithms

One paper specifically about online routing can be found below.

Stochastic Online Shortest Path Routing: The Value of Feedback
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7367.pdf

The survey paper on DL job scheduling can be found below.

## Totoro's referred papers:
* [Next-Hop Routing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5955086)
    * Totoro made performance comparison to this paper.
* [End-to-End Routing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.4748.pdf)
    * Totoro made performance comparison to this paper.
* [Totoro's distributed hop-by-hop routing](https://hal.science/hal-01575796v1/file/combes_stochastic_online_shortest.pdf) 
    * Totoro refered to the hop-by-hop routing algorithm in this paper.
