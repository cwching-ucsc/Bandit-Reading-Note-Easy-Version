# Bandit Reading Note

## Dr. Ji's recommanded open source bandit textbooks:

Please see below two books on multi-armed bandits.

Introduction to Multi-Armed Bandits (Sec. 7.1 is about online routing problem)
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07272.pdf

Bandit Algorithms
https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf

One paper specifically about online routing can be found below.

Stochastic Online Shortest Path Routing: The Value of Feedback
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7367.pdf

The survey paper on DL job scheduling can be found below.

Deep Learning Workload Scheduling in GPU Datacenters: Taxonomy, Challenges and Vision
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11913.pdf

The second book (see below) is very well written. I'd suggest reading Chs. 1 and 4 for the basic setting of MAB and Chs. 6 and 7 for some well-known algorithms (e.g., UCB).
